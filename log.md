# Operation Log

Append-only chronological record of wiki operations. Newest entries at the
bottom. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <operation> | <subject>`.

Operations:
- **ingest** — a raw source was read and woven into the wiki
- **query** — a question was answered from the wiki (and, if durable, filed to `wiki/synthesis/`)
- **lint** — a health pass for contradictions, stale claims, orphans, gaps
- **pipeline** — transcription/backlog/infrastructure events

Never rewrite or delete past entries. Append only.

## [2026-08-01] pipeline | Wiki scaffolded
Initial vault structure created for three tracked experts (Chris Harris, Matt
Harmon, Matt Waldman) across Best Ball / Dynasty / Redraft formats.

## [2026-08-02] pipeline | Transcript source moved to local Whisper
Replaced a dependency on Apple Podcasts' local transcript cache (which stalled,
then began failing outright on macOS TCC authorization) with public RSS feeds +
local `whisper.cpp` transcription. Free, offline, ~24× realtime. Researched and
rejected: Spotify (no API access), YouTube (Chris Harris absent; Reception
Perception posts only segments), Taddy/Rephonic/Podscribe (cost), Podcast Index
(pass-through only), paid ASR (strictly worse than free local).

## [2026-08-02] pipeline | Backlog drain — 150 episodes
Two batches (50 + 100) transcribed locally, 150/150 succeeded, zero failures.
Covers Dec 2023 – Oct 2024. ~5.3 hours total at ~2.1 min/episode.

## [2026-08-02] pipeline | Reset Apple-derived wiki notes
The first 7 episodes had been ingested from Apple TTML transcripts, out of
chronological order (they are the newest episodes). Removed all wiki content
derived from them and returned those episodes to `pending` so every source is
processed identically — Whisper transcript, chronological order. Prior state
tagged `pre-reindex-apple-transcripts`.

## [2026-08-03] pipeline | Restructured to Karpathy llm-wiki pattern
Reorganized into the three-layer pattern: immutable `raw/` sources, LLM-owned
`wiki/`, and `CLAUDE.md` schema. Added `index.md` (page catalog) and this
`log.md`. Added `wiki/synthesis/` for filed query answers supporting draft and
waiver decisions. All 154 transcripts preserved and verified byte-identical
(1,614,588 words). Prior state tagged `pre-karpathy-restructure`.

## [2026-08-03] pipeline | Physical separation of ingested transcripts
Split the raw layer into `raw/transcripts/` (awaiting ingestion) and
`raw/ingested/` (done), so the folder itself is a visible work queue rather than
requiring a `state.json` query. Transcript *contents* remain immutable; the only
permitted change is this one relocation. Added `scripts/verify_integrity.py` to
reconcile state against disk — detects missing files, wrong tree, stale paths,
duplicate basenames, and orphans, with `--fix` to repair. Verified it catches and
repairs a simulated half-completed move.
